        Reading is a way for me to expand my mind, open my eyes, and fill my
        heart.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Reading is Essential and serves as a basic building block for learning,
        regardless of the school subject, be it language arts or even math. In
        daily life, the need to read things such as street signs or
        prescriptions proves reading is also an important life skill. 2. Reading
        Strengthens the Brainand improves memory. One of the benefits of reading
        is that it allows you to master the best of what other people have
        already figured out. This is only true if you can remember and apply the
        lessons and insights from what you read.
